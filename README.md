# Daraprim
This repo is the home for all Breaking Good activities related to the synthesis of Daraprim and it's analogs.

Daraprim is the trade name for the medicine pyrimethamine. The molecule was developed by the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Gertrude Elion and has been available since the 1950s. Originally used for the treatment of malaria, it remains part of the wider malaria toolbox but is most commonly used for the treatment of another parasite, gondii which causes Toxoplasmosis. Daraprim is on the World Health Organisation's list of essential medicines and is cheaply available in most countries.

In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the marketing rights for Daraprim and hiked the price of this essential method by 5500% overnight, from $13.50 to $750 a pill. This decision led to considerable public outrage and prompted all three US presidential candidates to vocalise criticism of this decision.
